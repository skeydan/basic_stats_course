## What is a confidence interval

* 95 % confidence is a confidence that in the long-run 95 % of the CIs will include the population mean. It is a confidence in the algorithm and not a statement about a single CI.
* In frequentist terms the CI either contains the population mean or it does not. 
* Relationship to p-values: if an effect is statistically different ( p < 0.05) from 0 in a
two-sided t -test with an alpha of .05, the 95% CI for the mean difference between two
groups will not include zero.
