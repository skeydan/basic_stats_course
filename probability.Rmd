# Probability

&nbsp;

## Fundamental axioms of probability (Kolmogorov)

1. The probability of any event is a positive real number.
2. The probability that _some_ event will occur is 1.
3. For any two disjoint events or sets of events \(e\) and \(f\), the probability of \(e\) _or_ \(f\) occurring is \(P(e) + P(f)\).

&nbsp;

## Probability of event A __OR__ event B happening: \(P(A\cup B)\)

* Disjoint events (see axiom 3 above): $$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$$
* Non-disjoint events: $$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$

&nbsp;

## Probability of event A __AND__ event B happening: \(P(A\cap B)\)

* General formulation:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A | B) * P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A)$$
* For independent events:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A | B) * P(B) = P(B | A) * P(A) = P(A) * P(B)$$

&nbsp;

## Independent events

* Events are _independent_ if
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$
