## Effect size

* How strong is an effect?
* g-family and r-family of measures
* Typical measures: Cohen's _d_, r (correlation coefficient)

## Cohen's _d_
* difference of means, in units of standard deviation
$$d = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{SD_{pooled}}$$ (see http://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/)
* Relationship to t statistic:

$$t = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{SD_{pooled} * \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}$$
$$d = t * \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}$$
## r and $R^2$
* how much of variation in dependent variable is explained by independent variable ($R^2$)
