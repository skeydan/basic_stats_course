## Power

* probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false
* = 1 - Type 2 Error ($1 - \beta$)


\[power = P\left(\frac{\bar X - \mu_0}{s /\sqrt{n}} > t_{1-\alpha,n-1} ~;~ \mu = \mu_a \right)\]


## Power increases with

* difference between $\mu_0$ and $\mu_a$
* alpha level
* sample size 

Of these, can only influence sample size

## Power decreases with

* standard deviation

## Power and effect size

* with fixed alpha, power only depends on the effect size

\[\frac{\mu_a - \mu_0}{\sigma}\]
