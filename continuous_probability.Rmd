## Continuous Probability Distributions


### Uniform Distribution

* valid between a minimum and a maximum value
* all intervals _of the same length_ between the minimum and the maximum values are equally probable
* application: often used as a prior distribution when we have no prior knowledge
* examples for discrete version of uniform distribution: die rolls
