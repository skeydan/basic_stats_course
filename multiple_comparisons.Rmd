## Bonferroni 

* control the family-wise error rate (FWER) at level alpha
* dividing alpha by the total number of tests performed
* may be too conservative

## Benjamini-Hochberg

* control the false discovery rate at level alpha
* calculate the p-values as usual
* order them from smallest to largest, $p_1, p_2,...p_m$.
* any result with $p_i <= \frac{(alpha*i)}{m}$ is declared significant
