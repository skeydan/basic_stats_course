## Multiple comparisons

* If you perform multiple hypothesis tests, the chance of a type 1 error increases
* Say you perform 20 tests, with alpha = .05: then the chance of _not_ committing a type 1 error is $.95^{20} = 0.35$!
* There are several methods of controlling the overall error rate, e.g.
    + Bonferroni correction
        + controls the family-wise error rate (FWER) at level alpha
        + dividing alpha by the total number of tests performed
        + may be too conservative
    + Benjamini-Hochberg
        + controls the false discovery rate at level alpha
        + calculates the p-values as usual, then orders them from smallest to largest, $p_1, p_2,...p_m$.
        + now, any result with $p_i <= \frac{(alpha*i)}{m}$ is declared significant
