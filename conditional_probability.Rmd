## Conditional Probability

* Probabilities change when _conditioning_ on additional information.
* Probability of \(A\) given \(B\):

$$P(A ~|~ B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

* Compare
    + general probability of being struck by lightning vs.
    + probability of being struck by lightning, provided you go out in the woods in a heavy thunderstorm
