## Conditional Probability

* Probabilities change when _conditioning_ on additional information.
* Probability of \(A\) given \(B\):

$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$


* If \(A\) and \(B\) are independent:

$$P(A ~|~ B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = P(A)$$

## Conditioning matters

* Probability of being struck by lightning vs. probability of being struck by lightning, provided you go out in the woods in a heavy thunderstorm
* Probability of contracting rare hereditary disease XYZ vs. probability of contracting rare hereditary disease XYZ, given parents have it

&nbsp;

## Bayes Theorem

* Prior probability \(P(A)\)
* Likelihood \(P(B|A)\)
* Evidence \(P(B)\)
* Posterior probability \(P(A)\)

$$P(A ~|~ B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}$$

* Classical examples: Medical test,
